# Todo: FlowPost Desktop — Production-Ready Windows MVP

**Plan:** `tasks/plan.md`
**Status:** Auth deferred by owner; building features without login (accounts first)
**Mode:** Windows x64, Flutter, existing Supabase backend, unsigned Inno Setup
**Rule:** A phase is done only when its gate passes. No next phase with a Must-fix.
**Owner override (2026-10-28):** login is deferred to the end. Build the real screens and local flows with no auth gate; real Supabase wiring resumes with identity. Phase gates for Phases 2–5 record local evidence only.

### Phase 0 evidence (2026-10-28)

- `flutter analyze`: no issues. `dart format --set-exit-if-changed lib test integration_test`: clean.
- `flutter test`: 60 passed. `flutter test integration_test -d windows`: 1 passed.
- Release build and `iscc installer/flowpost.iss`: success; output `dist-desktop/FlowPostNativeSetup.exe`.
- Install/uninstall: silent install exit 0, Start Menu shortcut present, `flowpost://` key present, uninstall removed app dir/shortcut/protocol key and kept `%APPDATA%\com.flowpost\FlowPost`.
- Cold start: 2.75 s, 2.10 s, 2.90 s, 2.87 s, 2.92 s (limit 3 s); title `FlowPost Studio`.
- Single instance: second launch exited, one process left; `flowpost://focus` and `flowpost://auth-callback` handed off to the primary.
- Close-to-tray: window hidden, process alive, one instance; restore via `flowpost://focus` brought it back visible with focus.
- Log scan after `code=FINAL123&state=FINAL456` callback: no code/state/token values.
- Manual scoped audit (`ponytail-audit` + `security-and-hardening` + `code-review-and-quality`): no Must-fix. Non-blocking notes: send-time resolution for schedules, server-side auth/RLS checks, publish timeout/retry semantics — scheduled for later phases.

---

## Phase 1 — Identity and Session (DEFERRED by owner 2026-10-28)

- [x] **1.1** Write `SPEC-identity.md` + ADR 0001 (dual auth session)
- [ ] **1.1a** Approve identity decisions: question cadence, admin-only, backend hardening, logout scope, credentials
- [ ] **1.2** Auth data layer: typed session, secure storage, refresh, logout
- [ ] **1.3** Login UI: email/password, Google, loading/error/offline
- [ ] **1.4** Google OAuth: system browser, PKCE/state, `flowpost://auth-callback`
- [ ] **1.5** Session restore, logout, expired/revoked handling
- [ ] **1.6** Phase 1 gate
  - [ ] Unit/widget tests green
  - [ ] Real Google login on installed build
  - [ ] Session survives restart; logout clears
  - [ ] No tokens in logs
  - [ ] `security-and-hardening` review
  - [ ] Scoped `ponytail-audit` no Must-fix
  - [ ] Human approval

---

## Phase 2 — Account Connections (no-auth local slice first)

- [x] **2.0** Navigation shell: Home, Accounts, Upload, Calendar, Settings routes
- [x] **2.1** `docs/spec/SPEC-accounts.md` written for the local slice; real function contracts deferred with identity
- [x] **2.2** Typed `AccountsRepository`; local JSON implementation with six seeded accounts
- [x] **2.3** Accounts screen: connected/disconnected/expired, connect/disconnect, loading/error/empty
- [x] **2.4** Local connect/disconnect state; persists across restart and reinstall; real browser flow deferred
- [ ] **2.5** Phase 2 gate (local)
  - [x] Repository and widget tests for six platforms
  - [x] Local connect/disconnect persists across restart (installed build; `accounts.json`)
  - [x] No token logged (this slice stores no tokens)
  - [x] `security-and-hardening` review: no secrets, fixed data path, untrusted file handled defensively
  - [x] Scoped `ponytail-audit` no Must-fix
  - [x] Human approval (owner, 2026-10-28)

**Evidence:** `flutter analyze` clean; 73 unit/widget tests pass; installed build shows six cards at the minimum window size (two columns, natural heights, 1.6× text scale tested); connect wrote `%APPDATA%\com.flowpost\FlowPost\accounts.json` and survived restart and reinstall; save-before-state and atomic temp-file rename verified by tests; icons verified in the 27-glyph release font after a clean build.

**Review fixes (2026-10-28):** save now completes before the card changes (no optimistic race); repository merges partial files back to six platforms and writes via temp file + rename; retry invalidates the repository as well as the controller; card grid uses natural heights and a wrapping header so large text cannot clip; temp-file rename over an existing file verified on Windows.

---

## Phase 3 — Media Pipeline

- [ ] **3.1** Write/approve `SPEC-media.md`; FFmpeg packaging ADR; fixtures
  - [x] `docs/spec/SPEC-media.md`: formats, 100 MB/180 s limits, normalization, workspace cleanup, caption/upload contracts
  - [x] `docs/adr/0002-bundle-ffmpeg.md`: pinned BtbN 8.1 LGPL shared, SHA-256, 161.2 MB, `libopenh264`, LGPL notices
  - [x] Fixtures generated; `expected.json` verified with the pinned build
  - [x] `libopenh264` encode + decode round-trip verified; probe JSON, frames, audio, corrupt-file rejection verified
  - [ ] Human review/approval of the FFmpeg and licensing decision
- [x] **3.2** File picker, validation, temp workspace
  - [x] `MediaValidation`: extension allowlist, 100 MB cap, empty/unreadable rejection
  - [x] `MediaWorkspace`: per-job folders, guarded deletion, stale-job sweep at startup
  - [x] Native Windows picker (`file_selector`) behind an injectable seam
  - [x] Upload screen: empty / checking / failed / picked states
- [ ] **3.3** FFmpeg probe/transcode/thumbnail/audio/frame extraction
- [ ] **3.4** Caption generation through existing edge function
- [ ] **3.5** R2 upload with progress and cleanup
- [ ] **3.6** Phase 3 gate
  - [ ] Fixture integration tests
  - [ ] Large-file run: no UI freeze, memory bounded
  - [ ] Temp files cleaned
  - [ ] `performance-optimization` review
  - [ ] `security-and-hardening` review
  - [ ] Scoped `ponytail-audit` no Must-fix
  - [ ] Human approval

### Phase 3.1 evidence (2026-10-28)

- **Spec:** `docs/spec/SPEC-media.md` — one file at a time; MP4/MOV/M4V/WEBM/MKV and JPG/PNG/WEBP; 100 MB and 180 s caps; remux-or-encode rules; 640×360 thumbnail; three 640-max-side frames at web timestamps; 16 kHz mono MP3; workspace cleanup and crash recovery; typed caption/upload contracts.
- **ADR:** `docs/adr/0002-bundle-ffmpeg.md` (Proposed) — BtbN FFmpeg 8.1 LGPL shared win64, zip 77.9 MB, SHA-256 `092B5E24…ADB5`; 161.2 MB / 9 files installed; `libopenh264` H.264; separate process, argument lists, `file` protocol allowlist; no GPL components.
- **Fixtures:** `desktop-flutter/test/fixtures/media/` — 10 files, 2.28 MB total: portrait H.264 MP4/MOV, VP9 WebM, 6 s H.264 MP4, JPG/PNG/WebP stills, Unicode/space still, 2 KB corrupt MP4, unsupported TXT. `expected.json` holds probe, normalization, thumbnail, frame, audio, and limit values.
- **Verified with the pinned build:** `ffmpeg n8.1.3-24-g92611900bb-20261027`; every probe matches `expected.json`; remux of MP4/MOV/6 s MP4 and encode of VP9 WebM produce H.264 `yuv420p` + AAC 48 kHz; 640×360 thumbnails; portrait frames 360×640; 6 s frames at 2/3/4 s are distinct; 16 kHz mono MP3 8.5 KB (2 s) and 24.2 KB (6 s); `corrupt.mp4` probe exits 1.
- **Encoder check:** 1080×1920 `libopenh264` encode exits 0 (Constrained Baseline, level 4.0, 997.6 KB for 2 s); full decode round-trip exits 0.
- **Gitignore:** `third_party/ffmpeg/` and `third_party/cache/` are ignored; binaries are fetched, fixtures are committed.
- **Deferred/blocked:** live caption and upload calls need identity; duplicate-free upload retry needs the `idempotency_key` change in `upload-local-file`; public-distribution H.264 patent position needs an owner decision (internal distribution accepted for the MVP).

### Phase 3.2 evidence (2026-10-29)

- **Validation** (`lib/features/media/domain/media_validation.dart`): MP4/M4V/MOV/WEBM/MKV and JPG/PNG/WEBP allowlist, 100 MB cap, empty-file and unreadable-file rejection with user-facing messages. Extension match is case-insensitive.
- **Workspace** (`lib/features/media/data/media_workspace.dart`): one folder per job under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.flowpost\FlowPost\media\jobs`, named by an internally generated id (`yyyyMMddTHHmmss-<6 hex>`) — no user-supplied text becomes a path. Deletion resolves symlinks, requires the target to sit inside the jobs root, and refuses the root itself. Leftover folders are swept at startup; a failed sweep logs the job id only, never a full path.
- **Picker** (`lib/features/media/data/media_file_picker.dart`): native Windows Open dialog with the "FlowPost media" filter, behind an injectable `MediaFilePicker` seam so the controller is testable.
- **Upload screen** (`lib/features/media/presentation/media_page.dart`): empty / checking / failed / picked states, size formatting, `Choose another file` releases the job folder.
- **Audit fix:** picking a second file orphaned the first job folder; the controller now deletes the previous job after the new one is created (covered by a failing-first test).
- **Gate:** `flutter analyze` no issues; `dart format --set-exit-if-changed lib test integration_test` clean; `flutter test` 104 passed; `flutter test integration_test -d windows --dart-define-from-file=config/dev.json` 1 passed (now also asserts the Upload screen opens from the nav rail); release build succeeded.
- **Live run (release build):** Upload screen renders; "Choose file" opens the native Open dialog with the "FlowPost media" filter; selecting `sample.png` showed "sample.png — Image — 213.2 KB" and created job `20261029T064638-a9dd11`; "Choose another file" returned to the empty state and removed the job folder (jobs root empty afterwards).
